## 10/13/2025 - Made Schematic  

Created Schematic

Chose to use 14 pins to attempt to mimic the Seeed Studio Xiao form factor
Potentially even using the same footprint to make it potentially interchangeable and possibly a HackClub rp2040 xiao form factor board. This could allow more smaller boards for macropads and such that don't need full size picos

## 10/16/2025 - Kicad to Easy Eda  

I moved my project from kicad to easyeda due to footprints being on easy eda already which means I don't need to create each of the footprints for my project that aren't in kicad from scratch. This saves time and also has more streamlined ordering method as easy eda and jlcpcb are heavily linked
