This is my journal of the design and building process of **RP 2040 Dev Board**.

## 10/13/2025 - Made Schematic  

Created Schematic

Chose to use 14 pins to attempt to mimic the Seeed Studio Xiao form factor
Potentially even using the same footprint to make it potentially interchangeable and possibly a HackClub rp2040 xiao form factor board. This could allow more smaller boards for macropads and such that don't need full size picos

## 10/16/2025 9 PM - Kicad to Easy Eda  

I moved my project from kicad to easyeda due to footprints being on easy eda already which means I don't need to create each of the footprints for my project that aren't in kicad from scratch. This saves time and also has more streamlined ordering method as easy eda and jlcpcb are heavily linked

## 10/16/2025 11:26 PM - Routed PCB  

I routed the pcb across 2 layers this design includes pin tabs that reach the outermost part of the board but causes errors as a consequence although this should be fine, at least I hope it will. This operates with 1x7 pins with the same pin out as the Seeed Studio Xiao Rp2040.

## 10/16/2025 11:29 PM - Quick Render ;D

** BEGINNING OF YAP **
This is rendered with a blue pcb as it was the default pcb it gave me, this shows the individual parts of the pcb: resistors, mcu, capacitors, linear voltage regulator, usb-c port ( Universal Serial Bus - Type C )
** END OF YAP **
