## 10/13/2025 - Made Schematic  

Created Schematic

Chose to use 14 pins to attempt to mimic the Seeed Studio Xiao form factor
Potentially even using the same footprint to make it potentially interchangeable and possibly a HackClub rp2040 xiao form factor board. This could allow more smaller boards for macropads and such that don't need full size picos
