## 10/13/2025 - Made Schematic  

Created Schematic

Chose to use 14 pins to attempt to mimic the Seeed Studio Xiao form factor
Potentially even using the same footprint to make it potentially interchangeable and possibly a HackClub rp2040 xiao form factor board. This could allow more smaller boards for macropads and such that don't need full size picos

## 10/16/2025 9 PM - Kicad to Easy Eda  

I moved my project from kicad to easyeda due to footprints being on easy eda already which means I don't need to create each of the footprints for my project that aren't in kicad from scratch. This saves time and also has more streamlined ordering method as easy eda and jlcpcb are heavily linked

## 10/16/2025 11:26 PM - Routed PCB  

I routed the pcb across 2 layers this design includes pin tabs that reach the outermost part of the board but causes errors as a consequence although this should be fine, at least I hope it will. This operates with 1x7 pins with the same pin out as the Seeed Studio Xiao Rp2040.

## 10/16/2025 11:29 PM - Quick Render ;D

** BEGINNING OF YAP **
This is rendered with a blue pcb as it was the default pcb it gave me, this shows the individual parts of the pcb: resistors, mcu, capacitors, linear voltage regulator, usb-c port ( Universal Serial Bus - Type C )
** END OF YAP **  

## 10/16/2025 11:42 PM - Added HackClub Branding  

Added HackClub stuff onto the pcb to show where it came from no matter who is looking at it, and free marketing is always fun, right? Added orpheus-flag-top and hackclub-rounded-icon. as there was empty space on the back and there was a perfect slant on the board outline for the orpheus flag top

All images from [here](https://hackclub.com/brand/)

## 10/17/2025 5:19 PM - Created Order on JLC PCB  

I created production files and edited BOM and CPL to be correct as some Capacitors were set to the wrong value. This was also spent adding images to my README.md although they aren't organised the best. Instead, they are below the important text, so it is more like a gallery below and not a detailed explanation.

## 10/17/2025 5:55 PM - Did a touch up to my README  

Did a touch up to my README:
- Resized images
- removed an image
- added pinout info
- added debug pinout info ( swd, gnd, swclk )
- improved summary
- corrected file path

This improved readability, and improved the experience of reading and viewing the README.md

## 10/20/2025 - Corrected Chip used  

Changed chip as the one previously selected was a 128mbit chip instead of 16mbit this wouldn't be compatible with the rp2040 due to it having a max flash size
